This project is not intended for use in any illegal or nefarious way, rather only to provide a simple method of automating recurring, identical tasks.

#### TODO:
- remove mouse logger exit on click and keyboard logger exit on esc
- send log to text file with each new action on a new line
- interpret text file back into actions
- implement saving logs to file to store for later recall
- encrypt saved logs
